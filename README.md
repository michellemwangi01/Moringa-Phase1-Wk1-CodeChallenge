## TITLE: Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator

## DESCRIPTION

This is a JavaScript program that takes a student's marks as input and determines their corresponding grade based on the marks. Here is a summary of the code:

The code defines a grading system where different ranges of marks correspond to different grades. It prompts the user to enter the student's marks using the prompt function and stores the input in the studentmark variable. It defines a function called studentGrader that takes the studentmark as a parameter.

Inside the studentGrader function, there is an if statement that checks if the studentmark is between 0 and 100 (inclusive). If the mark is valid, the code proceeds to determine the grade. If the mark is not valid, the code displays a message asking the user to enter a valid grade.

A switch statement is used to compare the studentmark against different cases representing the grade ranges. If a case evaluates to true, meaning the studentmark falls within that range, the corresponding grade is printed out. If none of the cases in the switch statement match the studentmark, the code does not print any grade. 

## PROJECT SETUP

## TITLE: Challenge 2: Speed Detector

## Description
Is a JavaScript program that determines the number of demerit points a driver should receive based on their speed. A brief breakdown of the code:

It declares and initializes two global variables. These variables will be used to store the speed limit and the number of demerit points, respectively. It then prompts the user to enter the driver's speed using the prompt function and stores the input in the driverSpeed variable. A function is used that accepts the speed parameter.  It will check the driver's speed and determine the demerit points.

The speedDetector function, checks if the speed is less than, equal to, or over the speed limit. For each of these cases a different message is printed. 

In case the speed is above the speed limit, the program calculates the number of demerit points to assign. In the scenario that the demeritPoints are greater than 12, the driver's license is suspended.
